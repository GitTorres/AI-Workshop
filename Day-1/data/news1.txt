KAVIK RIVER CAMP, Alaska (AP) - Alaska's North Slope was hit Sunday by the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the region, the state's seismologist said.
At 6:58 a.m. Sunday, the magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck an area 42 miles (67 kilometers) east of Kavik River Camp and 343 miles (551 kilometers) northeast of Fairbanks, the state's second-biggest city. The U.S. Geological Survey says the earthquake had a depth of about 6 miles (9.9 kilometers.)
State seismologist Mike West told the Anchorage Daily News that the earthquake was the biggest recorded in the North Slope by a substantial amount.  "This is a very significant event that will take us some time to understand," he told the Daily News.
